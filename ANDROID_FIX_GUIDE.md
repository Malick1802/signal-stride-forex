# Android App Update Fix Guide

Your Android app wasn't updating because of several issues that have been fixed:

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Build Scripts
- Added proper Android build scripts to handle the build process
- Enhanced Supabase client with Android-specific real-time settings
- Created dedicated Android sync hook for better connectivity

### 2. Real-Time Data Sync Issues
- **Enhanced Supabase real-time connection** with aggressive reconnection
- **Added cache-busting headers** to prevent stale data
- **Implemented force refresh** for signals and prices when app becomes active
- **Background sync every 30 seconds** to keep data fresh

### 3. Build Process Issues
- **Proper Android build configuration** now in place
- **Cache clearing** to prevent old data from persisting
- **Force rebuild** with Capacitor sync

## How to Deploy Updated APK

### Option 1: Use the Fix Script (Easiest)
```bash
# Run the comprehensive fix script
scripts\android-fix-and-deploy.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps
```bash
# 1. Clean everything
npx vite build --config vite.config.android.ts --mode production --force

# 2. Force sync with Capacitor
npx cap clean android
npx cap sync android --force

# 3. Deploy to device
npx cap run android
```

## What's Been Improved

### Real-Time Connectivity
- ✅ **Automatic reconnection** when connection is lost
- ✅ **Force data refresh** when app becomes active
- ✅ **Background sync** every 30 seconds
- ✅ **Enhanced timeout handling** for Android networks
- ✅ **Cache-busting headers** to prevent stale data

### Signal Updates
- ✅ **Real-time signal outcome updates** without needing web app
- ✅ **Automatic price updates** in background
- ✅ **Force refresh** when switching back to app
- ✅ **Better error handling** and retry logic

### Build Process
- ✅ **Proper Android build scripts** in place
- ✅ **Enhanced Capacitor configuration** for production
- ✅ **Comprehensive cache cleaning** 
- ✅ **Force rebuild** capabilities

## Verification Steps

1. **Deploy the updated APK** using one of the methods above
2. **Check real-time updates** - signals should update automatically
3. **Test price updates** - prices should change without connecting to web
4. **Test app background/foreground** - data should refresh when you switch back

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. **Run the fix script** first: `scripts\android-fix-and-deploy.bat`
2. **Check Android logs** in Android Studio for any connection errors
3. **Verify internet connection** on your device
4. **Try force-closing** and reopening the app

The Android app should now work independently with real-time updates!
